## üìÇ Main Projects

### üì° Antenna Design Simulation and Constructions
<<<<<<< HEAD
Design of patch antennas [Patch antenna B7 LTE](https://github.com/Merituum/patch2600LTE)<br>
Log-periodic antennas [LPDA for LTE (B1, B3, B7)](https://github.com/Merituum/LPDA_1.8-2.6GHz)<br>
Currently working on a beam steering system for communication with the ISS [ISS Project](https://github.com/Merituum/ISSproject)<br>
Repository is hidden since paper about this project is about to be published at KRiT (National Conference of Radiocommunications and ICT)
